AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of data related to supplier performance, production schedules, and delivery times, to help businesses identify bottlenecks in their supply chain and make adjustments accordingly. This can result in more efficient and cost-effective supply chains, which can have a positive impact on a company\u2019s bottom line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1dd7\">AI is also helping logistics companies to better predict demand.
